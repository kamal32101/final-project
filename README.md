# **Education Performance Dataset Analysis**
### An education analytics case study using Excel, SQL, Python and Power BI


## Case Summary

This project aims to analyze an education performance dataset to evaluate factors that influence students' outcomes such as repetitve trends, performance gaps and other key factors that influence said outcomes to aid educational institutions in improving students' performance & enhancing teaching and learning strategies with data-driven decision making.


## Case Objectives
- Analyze student academic performance across different subjects
- Identify key factors that influence student achievement
- Evaluate performance trends and patterns within the dataset
- Assess differences in performance across demographic groups
- Present insights using interactive dashboards


## Dataset Overview
